## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties

### What I learned

As part of my first steps in learning HTML and CSS, i could say every part of this was a very important learning process for me.  The HTML part of it came quite easy for me, experienced a bit of difficulty writing the CSS but after much Google searches, i was able to get the desired result.
